You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. 
Answer the following questions:
 

* What new skills have you learned?
 
Some new skills that I learned were a result of me trying to be lazy and efficient; I learned how to navigate a text editor without moving my mouse too much.

* What has been easy?

What has been easy was learning the html syntax and keeping them in mind while doing projects.  

* What has been difficult?
  
Being meticulous and quick at the same time while completing projects.

* How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

Your response goes here!
From the first project, I just learned a lot of syntax to make text look like how I want it to look, so I just translated the knowledge and skills over to this project.
